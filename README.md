# RayleighCorrection
Rayleigh Correction Based on py6s

Aersol and Rayleigh reflection accout for more than 80% signal in the field of ocean color remote sensing.

Untill now, the aersol correction still could result in huge error especially in the coastal and inland area. Alternatively, the raleigh corrected relfectance is another choice instead of remote sensing reflectance, since it is very mature.

This repo include several commonly used polar-orbit and geostationary rayleigh correction implentation based on py6s.

Current Status: Himawari-8

In Progress: GK2A, MODIS-aqua, HY1/COCTS, Sentinel 3/OLCI, GCOM-C/SGLI,GOCI/COMS

Looking forward to your email and looking for partners.
